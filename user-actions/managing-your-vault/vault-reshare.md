# Vault Reshare

Re-share is a feature that allows you to re-share the Vault to all the other devices again, it is also possible to increase or decrease the number of parties participating in the Vault.

Do this if a device was lost and want to include a new, unique device or to make sure all devices have compatible shares.

After clicking on "Re-share" in the Vultisig menu, the subsequent steps are very similar to creating a Vault: [#setup](../creating-a-vault.md#setup)

## Changing the Number of Parties

Changing the number of parties is as simple as re-sharing the Vault to the name old devices, and joining the Keygen ceremony or leaving a device out.

After re-sharing a vault, the vault shares of each device also change. Therefore, the old shares that weren't present at the ceremony will be invalid and will not be able to sign any transactions.

**When you re-share, remove or add a device from your vault, make sure that you ALWAYS back up the vault shares!**
