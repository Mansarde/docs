# Vault Reshare

Re-share is a feature that allows you to re-share each vault share to the other devices in the Vault, as well as increase or decrease the number of parties.

Do this if you lost a device and want to include a new, unique device or make sure all devices have compatible shares.

After clicking on "Re-share" in the Vultisign menu, the subsequent steps are very similar to creating a Vault: [#setup](../creating-a-vault.md#setup)

## Changing the Number of Parties

Changing the number of parties is as simple as re-sharing to the old devices, creating a new Vault on the new device, and joining the Keygen ceremony or leaving a device out.

After re-sharing a vault, the vault shares of each device also change. Therefore, the old shares that weren't present at the ceremony will be invalid and will not be able to sign any transactions.

**When you remove or add a device from your vault, make sure that you back up the vault shares after a re-share.**
