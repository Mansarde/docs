description: Resharing Vault Shares with paired devices

# Vault Reshare

Reshare is a feature that allows you to reshare each share to the other devices in the Vault, as well as increase or decrease the number of parties.

Do this if you lost a device, and want to include a new, unique device or make sure all devices have compatible shares.

After clicking on "Reshare" in the Vultisig menu, the subsequent steps are very similar to creating a Vault: [#setup](../creating-a-vault.md#setup "mention")

### Changing the number of parties

Changing the number of parties is as simple as resharing to the old devices, creating a new Vault on the new device, and joining the keygen ceremony or leaving a device out. \
\
After resharing a vault, the vault shares of each device also change. Therefore, the old shares that weren't present at the ceremony will be invalid and will not be able to sign any transactions.
