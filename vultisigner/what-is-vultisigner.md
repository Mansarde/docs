# What is a Vultisigner

{% hint style="info" %}
Vultisigner is still to be implemented
{% endhint %}

Vultisigner is a feature of Vultisig that allows for the automatic co-signing of transactions within a user's Vault, but only under pre-defined parameters set by the Vault owner. It acts as an automatic co-signer that engages only when specific user-defined criteria are met.

This functionality allows users to manage a Vultisig vault that inherently operates as a multi-device vault while providing the user experience of a single-signature wallet when signing transactions, particularly in a 2-of-2 Vault configuration. When used in a 2-of-3 setup, it significantly enhances security.&#x20;

Additionally, Vultisigner ensures that funds undergo automatic security checks that are consistently met once configured. These features can be modified by obtaining the threshold majority of vault shares and signing a transaction, offering flexibility in maintaining and updating security protocols.
