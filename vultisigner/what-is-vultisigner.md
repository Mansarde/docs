# What is a Vultisigner

{% hint style="info" %}
Vultisigner is still to be implemented
{% endhint %}

Vultisigner is a feature of Vultisig that provides the ability to automatically co-sign transactions in a user's Vault, but only under pre-defined parameters by the Vault owner. 

It is an automatic co-signer that only signs when the user-defined characteristics are met. This means that the user has the ability to have a Vultisig that is inherently a multi-device vault that feels like a single signature wallet when signing transactions.&#x20;

With that it gives the ability to further improve security and accessibility without making the set-up more complicated. \
This also helps funds yo have automatic security checks in place that are always met once they are set.  &#x20;

These features can be changed with the threshold majority of vaults and signing a transaction.
