Vultisigner is a feature of Vultisig that provides the ability to automatically co-sign transactions in your vault, but only under predefined circumstances by the user. 

It is an automatic co-signer that only signs when the user-defined characteristics are met. 
This means that the user has the ability to have a Vultisig that is inherently a multi-device vault that feels like a single signature wallet.  
With that it gives the ability to further improve security and accessibility without making the set-up more complicated. 
This also helps funds yo have automatic security checks in place that are always met once they are set.  
These features can be changed with the threshold majority of vaults and signing a transaction.
