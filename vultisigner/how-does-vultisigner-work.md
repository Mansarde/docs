# How does a Vultisigner work?

A vault share is shared with a dedicated Vultisig server, where the vault is stored with instructions on when that vault share should sign any transactions that are initiated.&#x20;

When a user wishes to sign a transaction, this request is sent to the Vultisig server, where the appropriate Vault share will only participate in the key signing process if certain set requirements are met.
