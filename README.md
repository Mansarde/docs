# Overview

## What is Vultisig

🙋‍♀️ Vultisig is a multi-chain multi-platform Threshold-Signature vault that does not need any specialised hardware. It supports most UTXO, EVM, BFT and EdDSA Chains.\
It is based on [Binance tss-lib](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/master), but adapted for the mobile environment.

Vultisig is built by the founders of [THORChain](https://thorchain.org) - who built the largest and oldest working multi-chain DEX with Threshold-signatures.

## How can it be used?

It is possible to create a vault with different setup options:

* 2 of 2 (fastest setup, not backed up)
* 2 of 3 (recommended, backed up)
* 3 of 4 (most secure)

_The above are the most popular vault configurations and more will come in the future._

## Why

🔮 Vultisigs are better than Single-sig or Multi-sig Wallets:

Vultisig vault shares do not store funds - thus no funds at risk if you lose a key. \
There is no on-chain registration of signing-keys. \
Vultisigs are compatible for all chains and fully DeFi compatible (Multi-sigs are not). \
📱 Vultisig uses your favourite Laptops, Tablets and Phones.

Rich, large screens with familiar UI, Secure Enclaves to store vault shares and with biometric locking. Does not look like a hardware device and therefore grant higher security.\
🌈 Vultisig is open-source, based on secure technology and is audited (see in [security.md](threshold-signature-scheme/security.md "mention"), _with further audits to come_). \
There is no registration required.

## Who should use it

Everyone should use it!\
It is far safer than anything else (mobile, desktop, hardware, etc).
